This application doesn't make much sense and it's sole purpose is to demonstrate some of the things I've learned during the course IN00CT08-3003.
The application is created with create-expo-app and it is optimized for iOS and tested with an iPhone XR using Expo Go. No optimizing or testing done with Android.

In order to try out the application and have it work, you need API credentials to Finavia API and Positionstack:
- https://developer.finavia.fi/
- https://positionstack.com/

Features:
- Find departing flights from Finavia airports and show the destinations on map
- Add flight routes to favorite routes and access the map view directly from your favorites list
- Play TicTacToe against AI that simulates the tactics of a three-year old (random()...) and see your win percentage
